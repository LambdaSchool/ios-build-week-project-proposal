# Project Proposal for iOS Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below (Remove `<placeholders>` and add your answers)
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Team Members:  James McDougall, Bohdan Tkachenko, Ian French
2. App Name:  Wine Flight
3. App Description (3-5 sentences):

   I'm going to give you two scenarios.  One: you have just proposed to the woman of your dreams and she has said yes. Imagine her surprise in that magical moment when a drone sets down with a small package containing a bottle of champagne and two customized champagne flutes to celebrate?  Two: you are out fishing with the lads and have run out of beer. Why waste time heading back to the marina when you can simply get a sixer flown right to you on the lake, maybe even with a bag of Cool Ranch that you are suddently craving? Wine flight will make this a reality. 
    
4. Your #1 Customer (Who would use your app? Why now?)
 
At Wine Flight we don't have a #1 customer because all of our customers are #1. Be it a bridal shower, gender reveal, marriage proposal, hunting trip or just because. The reason is not important to us. Your satisfaction is. Now, more than ever, people are flocking to no contact delivery service and this one would have them all looking up. 

## Part 1: Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)
    1. Mind Map (15 minutes)
        1. Set a timer for 15 minutes
        2. Grab a piece of paper and write your app name in the center
        3. Add as many ideas and connections (Don't stop early, keep going until the timer ends)
        4. If you still have ideas, reset the timer and do it again
        5. Take a photo of your mind map and upload it to your proposal (YourName-Mindmap.jpg)
    2. Organize a List (15 minutes)
        1. Set a timer for 15 minutes
        2. Make a list on paper (or Markdown) and capture all your ideas from the mindmap
        3. If new ideas appear, write those down too
        4. Take a photo of your organized list and upload it to your proposal (YourName-List.jpg or YourName-List.md)
    3. Prioritize (5 minutes)
        1. What features does your #1 customer need most?
        2. Choose 3-5 features that make the core app experience
        3. Add these features to your `## Top Features` section
    4. Sketch (15 minutes)
        1. Draw a rectangle in the center of a paper
        2. Sketch a rough idea of what buttons, labels, images would be on the screen
        3. Repeat this for 3-5 of your top features
        4. Add annotations to your sketches (i.e.: point out how gesture interactions or animations might work)
        5. Take a photo of each mockup
    5. Share (15 minutes)
        1. Pair up with a fellow student and show them your idea (Screenshare on Zoom)
        2. Take notes and write down any of their ideas
2. If you have tons of ideas, set a timer again and keep going.
3. Don't filter yourself in the brainstorming phase, you want to capture everything and anything

## Top Features (Prioritize)

Add your top 3-5 features (core functionality) from the Prioritize brainstorming step. These should be things that are part of the MVP (not a log in screen). Build for the demo day (i.e.: Apple never shows how to log into the Apple ID on stage).

1.  Deliver a package (wine/beer/etc.) in a special manner and to areas that might be inaccessible to ground vehicles.
2.  Helps them get what they want, where they want. 
3. TBD

## Part 2: Project Plan (once the project sprint starts)

Take a step away from your computer and go for a walk. Your brain will continue to think about your app idea.

1. Add your tasks to your Kanban board in GitHub
2. Be specific in your tasks so that they are actionable.
    1. "Create View Controllers" is vague and isn't clear when you're finished
    2. "Create Table View Controller for GIFCell rows" and "Create Custom GIFTableViewCell" are specific
3. Organize your tasks (Drag and drop)
    1. Break down large tasks into subtasks
    2. If you don't know how to do a task, add to research it (i.e: "Research: AVFoundation Video Thumbnails API" or "Read: Core Graphics Programming Guide")
4. Start on your most difficult task first
5. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
