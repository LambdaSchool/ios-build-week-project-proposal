 Top Features
 1. Scheduling Timer
    - this is a way for users to schedule and calendar when their plants need to be watered. The hope would be to sync their calendars with the OS of the phone.
 2. Push Notifications
    - though minor, this feature is very useful to our users as reminders to water their plants
 3. picture/video of plant
    - users can have this feature to keep track of their plant and its growth
